==== Java Config

===== Integrating WebAuthnProcessingFilter

`WebAuthnProcessingFilter`, which listens WebAuthn authentication requests can be configured with JavaConfig.
Please define a configuration class, make it inherit `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, apply `WebAuthnLoginConfigurer`
in a method overrides `configure(HttpSecurity http)`.
`WebAuthnLoginConfigurer` has a factory method named `webAuthnLogin()`, which can be utilized.

```java

import static WebAuthnLoginConfigurer.webAuthnLogin;

public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

        // WebAuthn Login
        http.apply(webAuthnLogin())
                .loginPage("/login")
                .usernameParameter("username")
                .passwordParameter("rawPassword");
    }
}
```

===== Integrating WebAuthnAuthenticationProvider

`WebAuthnAuthenticationProvider`, which is a `AuthenticationProvider` for Web Authentication, can also be configured with
JavaConfig. Please apply `WebAuthnAuthenticationProviderConfigurer` to a configuration class inherits
`WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.
To support multi-factor authentication with password and authenticator, `MultiFactorAuthenticationProvider` is what you
need, and `MultiFactorAuthenticationProviderConfigurer` configures it for you.

There are some points to be kept in mind when using `MultiFactorAuthenticationProvider`.
`AuthenticationProvider` to be delegated cannot to be registered to `AuthenticationManager`. If you delegate authentication
to `DaoAuthenticationProvider`, it is important not to use `DaoAuthenticationConfigurer` or
`AuthenticationManagerBuilder#userDetailsService`.

```java
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    public void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder builder) throws Exception {
        builder.apply(new WebAuthnAuthenticationConfigurer<>(userDetailsService));
        builder.apply(new MultiFactorAuthenticationProviderConfigurer<>(daoAuthenticationProvider));
    }
}
```

==== User directory integration

Spring Security WebAuthn looks up a user through the `WebAuthnUserDetailsService` interface.
Please set a class implementing `WebAuthnUserDetailsService` to the `WebAuthnAuthenticationProvider` and the delegated
 `AuthenticationProvider`.

==== Validation on an authenticator registration

While it is basically application's responsibility to handle an authenticator registration process, Spring Security WebAuthn
provides converters and validators to examine the credential in question.
`Base64StringToCollectedClientDataConverter` converts Base64 string to a `CollectedClientData`.
`Base64StringToAttestationObjectConverter` converts Base64 string to a `AttestationObject`.

`WebAuthnRegistrationRequestValidator` validates an authenticator registration request.

==== Client interface specification

Web Authentication defines browser JavaScript APIs only. It is up to implementation the way to send corrected credential.
Regarding Spring Security WebAuthn, `WebAuthnProcessingFilter` retrieves `credentialId`, `clientData`, `authenticatorData`,
`signature`, `clientExtensionsJSON` for authentication, and `credentialId`, `clientData`, `authenticatorData` and
`signature` is binary data, please send them as Base64 strings.

==== Options endpoint specification

Web Authentication requests to obtain a challenge from the server prior to authentication.
When using the FIDO-U2F token as an authentication device, the CredentialIds associated with the user identified by
the first authentication factor are also need to be obtained from the server.
To retrieve these data, Spring Security WebAuthn offers `OptionsEndpointFilter`.

=== Customization

==== Selecting authentication method

Spring Security WebAuthn supports "Password-less multi-factor authentication with a user-verifying authenticator",
"Multi-factor authentication with password and authenticator" and "Single-factor authentication like password".
If you put value on adoption, you may allow password authentication in your web system, or if you give greater importance
to security, you may restrict password authentication.


===== How to restrict password authentication

Restriction of single-factor authentication like password can be configured per user basis.
`MFAUserDetails` interface, which is a base interface of `WebAuthnUserDetails` has `isSingleFactorAuthenticationAllowed`
method. If an implementing class returns `true` by the method, the user can pass the authentication with only a single-factor
like password.

===== MultiFactorAuthenticationProvider

Spring Security WebAuthn utilizes `MultiFactorAuthenticationProvider` to realize multi-factor authentication.
`MultiFactorAuthenticationProvider` is an `AuthenticationProvider` interface implementation, which delegates authentication
decision itself to another `AuthenticationProvider`. If authentication succeeds in the delegated `AuthenticationProvider`
and single-factor authentication is not permitted, `MultiFactorAuthenticationProvider` returns a `MultiFactorAuthenticationToken`
instead of the `Authentication` returned from `AuthenticationProvider`.

`MultiFactorAuthenticationToken` is an `Authentication` interface implementation represents partial finish of
multi-factor authentication. It is treated as a principal that has not authenticated like `AnonymousAuthenticationToken`.

To realize multi-factor authentication with password and authenticator, setup a `MultiFactorAuthenticationProvider`,
delegate password authentication to a `DaoAuthenticationProvider`, and register the `MultiFactorAuthenticationProvider`
to the `AuthenticationManager`. The `DaoAuthenticationProvider`, which is delegated to, must not to be registered to
the `AuthenticationManager` to avoid it processes an `Authentication` directly, and finishes authentication without
 second-factor verification.

===== WebAuthnAuthenticationProvider

`WebAuthnAuthenticationProvider` is an `AuthenticationProvider` implementation to process a
`WebAuthnAssertionAuthenticationToken`. For WebAuthn assertion verification, `WebAuthnAuthenticationContextValidator` is
used. See https://webauthn4j.github.io/webauthn4j/ja/[WebAuthn4J reference] for more details of
`WebAuthnAuthenticationContextValidator`.


=== Advanced topics

==== Distinction of a user in the middle of multi-factor authentication

In the case where it is needed to show a different login view like the one asks an authenticator for the user whose
first factor is verified but second factor is not provided yet, the distinction can be made by checking the type of
`Authentication` instance is a descendant of `MultiFactorAuthenticationToken` or not.

```java
@RequestMapping(value = "/login", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public String login() {
    Authentication authentication =
            SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
    if (authentication instanceof MultiFactorAuthenticationToken) {
        return ViewNames.VIEW_LOGIN_AUTHENTICATOR_LOGIN;
    } else {
        return ViewNames.VIEW_LOGIN_LOGIN;
    }
}
```

==== Configuring a credential scope (rpId)

In Web Authentication specification, the scope of a creating credential can be configured through the parameter named
"rpId" while creating the credential i.e. registering authenticator. "rpId" accepts
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#concept-origin-effective-domain[effective domain].
For example, in the case where the domain of the site is `webauthn.example.com`, and `webauthn.example.com` is set to
`rpId`, the credential is only available in `webauthn.example.com` and its sub-domain, but if `example.com`
is set to `rpId`, the scope of the credential is relaxed to `example.com` and its sub-domain.

Spring Security WebAuthn supports `rpId` configuration through the `rpId` property of `ServerPropertyProviderImpl`.

==== Attestation statement verification

Web Authentication specification allows the relying party to retrieve an attestation statement from an authenticator if
it is requested while authenticator registration. By verifying attestation statement, the relying party can exclude
authenticators not conforming its security requirements. It's to be noted that the attestation statement contains
information that can be used to track user across web sites, it is discouraged to request an attestation statement
unnecessarily. It is also to be noted that the browsers shows an additional dialog to confirm the user consent, lowers
usability. Except for enterprise applications that require strict verification of authenticators, most sites should not
request attestation statements.

`WebAuthnRegistrationContextValidator` from WebAuthn4J validates an authenticator registration request, and it delegates
attestation statement signature and trustworthiness validation to `AttestationStatementValidator` and
`CertPathTrustworthinessValidator` interface implementation respectively.

`WebAuthnRegistrationContextValidator.createNonStrictRegistrationContextValidator` factory method can create the
`WebAuthnRegistrationContextValidator` instance that contains `AttestationStatementValidator` and
`CertPathTrustworthinessValidator` configured for web sites not requiring strict attestation verification.

==== TrustAnchorProvider using Spring Resource

While validating an authenticator attestation certificate path on registration,
`TrustAnchorCertPathTrustworthinessValidator` class uses `TrustAnchor` retrieved through `TrustAnchorProvider` interface
implementation. Spring Security WebAuthn offers `KeyStoreResourceTrustAnchorProvider` class, which retrieves a
`TrustAnchor` from a Java Key Store file loaded as Spring `Resource`.
